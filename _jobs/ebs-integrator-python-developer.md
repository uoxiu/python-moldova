EBS Integrator is a software development company that has been creating customized mobile and web business solutions since 2010.

We design flexible and scalable product architecture while using the latest technology in mobile development and network infrastructure. 
Most of our digital transformation initiatives are focused on building self-contained, highly efficient, and reusable building blocks that speak data.

Our experience proved that Python and its frameworks are one of the best-fitting technologies out there - hence Python Engineers lay at the center of our gravity.

If you are a developer who seeks rich experiences in building data-centric, high-load, and scalable solutions.

If you would rather work across multiple verticals than focus on a single-pathed experience.

If you love keeping up with innovations across anything Python, our doors are open.

In exchange, we guarantee access to state-of-the-art tools, a knowledge base, and many other elements of a healthy learning environment, to grow and explore your chosen potential.

**Job Responsibilities:**

*   Develop functionalities according to Business Requirements Documentation and acceptance criteria; 
*   Follow SDLC delivery and take part in all software development phases; 
*   Write efficient, reusable, and test-adherent code; 
*   Act within a high level of autonomy and capacity. 

**Skills & Qualifications:**

*   4+ years of experience working in Python; 
*   Solid Knowledge Base (KB) of Django, Fast API, or Flask, including experience in Software Engineering Design and Development; 
*   Intermediate, or upper intermediate English; 
*   Good unit test and debugging skills; 
*   Solid KB of SCM with a strong emphasis on Git and Git Flow.
