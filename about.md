Welcome to Moldova Python Community, a place aimed at fostering communication among Python engineers in Moldova, 
where you can contribute and stay updated on the latest trends.

We encourage the exchange of information and knowledge in the field of the Python programming language, 
assisting each other in problem-solving through content shared on our communication channels.

Our goal is to build a strong community of engineers who apply Python in programming. To achieve this, 
a Telegram channel has been created, where there are already over 400 specialists and Python language users.
